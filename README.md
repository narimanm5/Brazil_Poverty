The project aims to investigate the determinants of poverty in Brazil using logistic regression analysis. The study explores the relationship between various socioeconomic factors and poverty levels, with a focus on identifying significant
determinants. It aims to contribute to the understanding of the factors driving poverty in Brazil and to provide insights for policymakers and organizations working on poverty alleviation.
The research utilizes logistic regression analysis to identify the determinants of poverty in Brazil. The analysis uses a combination of socioeconomic variables, including employment status, race,
education level, and potentially other relevant factors. The dataset used is representative of the Brazilian population, and statistical techniques are employed to ensure validity and reliability of the findings.
The research findings indicate that several factors are significantly associated with poverty in Brazil. Not having a work permit, being non-white, and having a low level of education emerge as the most significant determinants of poverty.
The analysis provides quantitative evidence of how these factors impact poverty levels in the Brazilian context. The study sheds light on the complex interplay of socioeconomic variables contributing to poverty and underscores the need for 
targeted interventions and policies.

The logistic regression analysis conducted in this project provides valuable insights into the determinants of poverty in Brazil. The research underscores the importance of addressing factors such as employment opportunities,
racial inequality, and educational access in poverty reduction efforts. By highlighting the significant relationships between these factors and poverty, the study contributes to the ongoing discourse on poverty alleviation and social equity in Brazil.
